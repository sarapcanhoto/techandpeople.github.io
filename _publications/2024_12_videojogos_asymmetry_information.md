In this image, the player is in the information room of the Weapon Challenge, reading an informational sign that features three symbols: two representing the different players and one corresponding to a hammer." # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "Addressing a gap in understanding nuanced variations of asymmetry of information, in this paper we propose a framework to analyse, ideate, design, and discuss asymmetry of information in gaming. We developed a digital cooperative game, exploring some of its dimensions, where players engage with information-based challenge puzzles. Through a user study involving ten pairs of players, we examined how various types of asymmetry of information influenced social interaction and player perspectives. Participants perceived asymmetry, influencing cooperation and progression. Asymmetry drove social interaction, shaping communication patterns and player engagement. Different configurations of asymmetry elicited distinct reactions, highlighting its impact on communication effectiveness and gameplay dynamics. Our study underscores the importance of understanding and leveraging dynamics such as these for crafting engaging and socially enriching gaming experiences."
