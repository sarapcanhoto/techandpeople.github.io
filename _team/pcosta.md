I am graduate with a bachelor’s degree in Information Technologies from the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon with a Minor in Multimedia Design, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Informatics, focusing on Accessibility and Health.

My interests are strongly connected to the Human-Computer Interaction field and User Experience. I am particularly motivated by the challenge of understanding how people interact with technology and designing solutions that are not only functional and intuitive, but also accessible, inclusive, and engaging.
