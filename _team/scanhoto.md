I hold a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Biology, as well as a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering. I am currently developing a project focused on inclusive health tracking technologies for transgender and non-binary individuals, in the context of enigmatic diseases, as part of my Master’s thesis under the supervision of Professors Ruben Gouveia and Tiago Guerreiro.

My main areas of interest include design, healthcare, mobile applications, and the creation of solutions that bring real value to society. In my free time, I enjoy creating macramé projects, reading, going to the gym, and playing online games.
