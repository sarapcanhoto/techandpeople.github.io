Upon finishing a bachelor’s degree in IT, as well as a minor in Media Design, I now pursue a master’s degree in Computer Science Engineering, with a focus on Video Game development at the University of Lisbon.

I am currently developing my thesis "Exploring determinants of sociality in multiplayer experiences", guided by Prof. André Rodrigues and David Gonçalves.
