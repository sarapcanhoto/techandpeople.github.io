I completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering and Multimedia at the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa (ISEL) and I am now in the second year of my Master’s in Informatics and Engineering. Since 2024, I have been working as a Teaching Assistant at ISEL.

My passion for video games led me to focus my Master’s thesis on “Reverse of Dark Patterns”, where I research ways to identify and redesign manipulative design strategies in games. Alongside my academic and professional work, I enjoy gaming, sports (having played rugby for 12 years) as well as movies and fishing.
