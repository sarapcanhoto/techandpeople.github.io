I am a MSc student at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon, currently developing my thesis on "Transmedial Play", under the supervision of Prof. André Rodrigues and Prof. João Guerreiro.

My main areas of interest include game design and development. I consider myself a very creative person, thorough in my work, and always trying to be inventive in everything I do.

Outside of my academic path, some of my favourite hobbies are movies, football, and gaming.
