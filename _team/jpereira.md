I completed my BSc in Computer Engineering and Multimedia at the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa (ISEL).  I'm now starting the second year of my MSc in Informatics Engineering and I've just begun working on my thesis, “RobotsVote: Do robots influence your vote?”

I have been a teaching assistant at ISEL since early 2024, and recently I also signed up as a volunteer teacher at a senior university.

I enjoy practically all sports(but preferably football), politics, movies, and photography.
